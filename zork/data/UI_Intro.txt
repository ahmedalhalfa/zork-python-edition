You have arrived at an island in the middle of nowhere in the atalntic sea.
it has a panel on its gate saying :
welcome to the island of APES, this island lords are apes but it has also many more dangerous creatures so be carful
and don't put yourself in danger.
So first things first, if you want to enter the island you must firstly move the bear from the gate, secondly you need
to answer some questions without lying or you will be put in the prison.
